# DESCRIPTION: Calculates two types of AUC (area under the curve), common for calculating hormonal changes over time. The function works by calculating the area of the rectangles and triangles that make up the measurement points, with respect to time. The funcion can calculate AUCg (AUC in respect to ground) or AUCi (AUC in respect to baseline).

# INPUT:        time: time points of the measurements,
#               measurement: measurements,
#               type: either "g" (default) , or  "i". See description. 
# OUTPUT: A single value that represents the selected AUC type
# EXAMPLE: calculate_auc(time = c(0, 15, 45, 90), measurement = c(5, 10.2, 12.3, 11.4), type = "g")
